# BCI-beta-desynchrony_2021
This repository contains Matlab scripts to run a non-overlapping temporal window DICS beamformer source analysis on the MEG trial responses of a mental imagery BCI task. Scripts were prepared for a research work titled "Mapping & decoding cortical engagement during motor imagery, mental arithmetic, and silent word generation using MEG". Scripts are prepared using Brainstorm and FieldTrip software tools. The work is under review for publication in NeuroImage.
