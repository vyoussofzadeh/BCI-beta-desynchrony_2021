# BCI-beta-desynchrony_2021
This repository contains a Matlab Brainstorm (BS)-FieldTrip (ft) batch script to run a non-overlapping temporal windows DICS beamformer source analysis on a MEG trial response. Scripts were prepared for a research work titled "Mapping Motor and Cognitive Tasks Imageries from MEG Beta Power Desynchrony Effects". The work is in preparation for journal submission. Scripts are compatible with BS 2020 and older.
